# CUDA
GPU program for solving linear algebra

In this university project I was called to resolve the problem of AT* A Matrix Multiplication.
This calculation usually is just a part of the program. However it might demands very high execution 
time compared to the whole program. So, a fast implemetention is very important.
To accomplish that I have used a NVidia card and the CUDA library, which allows GPU programming.
Moreover, I compared my solution with the build in function of Cublas library and I recorded the 
execution times.
